
Disconnected Data Access CRUD Operations
ORM: Entity Framework Core
Concurrency:
State less Applications
explicit invocation of function vs implicit invocation of function

Normal function vs Callback function
Normal function vs Arrow Funcation
Blocking call vs NonBlocking call
Direct call vs Indirect call
Synchronous call vs Asynchronous call
All action methods belong to Controller are invoked indirectly
